# Blockchain P2P Network with Pinning Attack Simulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **Blockchain** system that includes a **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network** and demonstrates a **Pinning Attack**. The project showcases how transactions are processed, mined, and how an attacker can exploit the system by pinning transactions to delay or block mining.

## Overview

This project simulates the working of a **blockchain** system with a **P2P network** where nodes participate in the mining process. The key features include:

- **Blockchain Implementation**: Transactions are stored and mined in blocks.
- **P2P Network**: Nodes can communicate with each other to broadcast transactions and mine blocks.
- **Pinning Attack**: A simulation of a pinning attack that delays the mining process by forcing nodes to solve additional computational puzzles.

### Key Concepts

- **Blockchain**: A decentralized ledger where each block contains a set of validated transactions.
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Mining a new block involves solving a cryptographic puzzle (PoW).
- **Pinning Attack**: Transactions with high computational difficulty (e.g., a puzzle to be solved) can be exploited to block or delay mining.
